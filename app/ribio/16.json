After the repeat is made, telomerase translocates 6 nucleotides to the right in the 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 direction of the DNA overhang and begins to make another repeat. The above process is repeated such that a series of tandem repeats are made, elongating the telomere.\n5. Then primase makes an RNA primer near the end of the telomere.

The longer the poly-A tail, the longer the mRNA can be used as a template to make proteins. The poly-A tail is removed by ribonucleases in the 3\u2019 to 5\u2019 direction until a critical length is reached which will trigger removal of the 5\u2019 cap and degradation of the mRNA from the 5\u2019 end too.\n\n# 2) Formation of translation initiation complex\n\nDuring translation initiation, small ribosomal subunit binds to 5\u2019 cap of mRNA. This can be prevented by binding of translational repressor to (1) 5\u2019 cap, (2) 5\u2019 UTR (untranslated region), (3) 3\u2019 UTR which interferes with the interaction between the 3\u2019 poly-A tail, the 5\u2019 cap, initiation factors, and the small ribosomal subunit which are needed for translation initiation.\n\nDuring translation initiation, translation initiation factors facilitate the binding of the small ribosomal subunit to the 5\u2019 cap. The availability of translation initiation factors is determined by whether or not they are phosphorylated. Some initiation factors are activated by phosphorylation while others are inactivated by phosphorylation. Without activated translation initiation factors, translation cannot begin.\n\n# Post-translational\n\n# Eukaryotes\n\n# 1) Formation of functional proteins\n\nCovalent modification/cleavage (eg. attachment of prosthetic groups, glycosylation, disulfide bond formation) of polypeptides make them functional proteins.\n\n# 2) Regulation of protein activity\n\nPhosphorylation / dephosphorylation of translation initiation factors can activate / deactivate the protein and hence up / down regulate its activity.\n\n# 3) Protein degradation\n\nProtein degradation by proteasomes determines how long a protein remains in a cell. Proteins targeted for degradation are tagged with ubiquitin (by ubiquitin ligase) and then recognized and degraded by the proteasome.\n\n# Causative factors which increase chances of cancer\n\n- A. Environmental factors: exposure to carcinogens (eg. tar in cigarette smoke, asbestos etc.) and ionizing radiation (e.g. uv radiation, X-rays) can cause mutations that lead to cancer\n- B. Loss of immunity due to infection with certain viruses: HIV can weaken the immune system and reduces the body\u2019s ability to fight infections by other viruses that can cause cancer. For example, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated Herpes virus genome can integrate into part of the human genome that controls DNA synthesis, or that affects cell division or that affects tumour suppression pathways and may lead to cancer\n- C.
