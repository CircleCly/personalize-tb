Living as they contain genetic material. However, non-living because they have no cellular organization and only show characteristics of living\n       things when in host cell.\n       Characteristics of living things include1) metabolic activity 2) cellular organization 3) ability to reproduce and grow in numbers 4) ability to respond to stimuli and adapt to environment\n  \u25aa    Why are viruses obligate parasites? This is because viruses, like obligate parasites, depend on host cells to complete their life cycle.\n\n  Structure of Viruses\n

                                                     (HIV)\n  Antigenic Drift : When the influenza virus replicates in its host cell, mutations frequently occur due to the poor proofreading mechanism of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the fast\n  replication rate of the virus. Over time, there is an accumutation of mutations in the viral genome. Sometimes, these mutations produce viruses with modified** surface antigens (e.g.\n  glycoproteins such as haemagglutinin or neuraminidase) with different conformation. If these viruses infect a host that does not have the antibodies that recognise these modified surface antigens, the\n  host becomes susceptibleto the virus.\n\n  Antigenic Shift: When a bird strain of influenza A and human strain of influenza A infect a single cell of an intermediate host (e.g.a pig), genetic reassortment can occur. Thus when new viruses\n  are assembled in the host cell, a new combinations of RNA segments can come together. Sometimes, genetic reassortment produces viruses with new** surface antigens (e.g. glycoproteins such as\n  haemagglutinin or neuraminidase). If these viruses infect a human host the host becomes susceptibleto the virus, as the host will not have the antibodies that recognise these new** surface antigens,\n\n    Prepared by: Mrs Selvamani Nair, Mdm Sharon Cross and Mrs Wong Seok Hui                                          Raffles Institution                                                                                                                     1",

However, non-living because they have no cellular organization and only show characteristics of living things when in host cell.\n- Characteristics of living things include:\n1. metabolic activity\n2. cellular organization\n3. ability to reproduce and grow in numbers\n4. ability to respond to stimuli and adapt to environment\n- Why are viruses obligate parasites? This is because viruses, like obligate parasites, depend on host cells to complete their life cycle.\n\n# Structure of Viruses\n\n| |Bacteriophages|Animal Viruses|\n|---|---|---|\n|Size:|10-300nm|Enveloped|\n| |T4 phage Lambda phage|Influenza Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)|\n|Genome|- Double-stranded DNA\n- Nucleic acid that codes for synthesis of viral components and enzymes for viral replication & assembly\n- Can be either DNA/RNA, single/double-stranded\n|- (-) strand RNA\n- 8 different segments of single stranded RNA associated with nucleoproteins\n- Each RNA segment is packed with 3 polymerase proteins which come together to form an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme complex which replicates and transcribes the viral genome in the host cell\n|\n| |- Present.\n|- Present, conical shaped\n|\n|Capsid|Icosahedral capsid head|Enzymes reverse transcriptase, integrase and protease found in capsid|\n|Envelope|- Absent\n- Phospholipid bilayer surrounding the nucleocapsid\n- Derived from host cell membrane\n- Embedded with viral glycoproteins involved in host cell recognition\n|- Glycoprotein embedded in envelope: gp41\n- gp120 is attached to gp41\n|\n\n# Antigenic Drift and Antigenic Shift\n\nAntigenic Drift: When the influenza virus replicates in its host cell, mutations frequently occur due to the poor proofreading mechanism of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the fast replication rate of the virus. Over time, there is an accumulation of mutations in the viral genome. Sometimes, these mutations produce viruses with modified surface antigens (e.g. glycoproteins such as haemagglutinin or neuraminidase) with different conformation. If these viruses infect a host that does not have the antibodies that recognise these modified surface antigens, the host becomes susceptible to the virus.\n\nAntigenic Shift: When a bird strain of influenza A and human strain of influenza A infect a single cell of an intermediate host (e.g. a pig), genetic reassortment can occur. Thus when new viruses are assembled in the host cell, a new combination of RNA segments can come together. Sometimes, genetic reassortment produces viruses with new surface antigens (e.g. glycoproteins such as haemagglutinin or neuraminidase). If these viruses infect a human host the host becomes susceptible to the virus, as the host will not have the antibodies that recognise these new surface antigens.\n\nPrepared by: Mrs Selvamani Nair, Mdm Sharon Cross and Mrs Wong Seok Hui\nRaffles Institution",
