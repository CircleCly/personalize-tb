Thus if a lysosome bursts, the enzymes are not very active as the cytosol has a neutral pH. However, if many lysosomes burst, then the cell will be destroyed.]\n\nPrepared by: Mrs Selvamani Nair\n\nRaffles Institution (Yr 5-6)",

Polypeptides enter the lumen of the cisternae of the RER where it undergoes modification. Transport vesicle buds off from the RER and carry the proteins to the GA. Vesicle fuses with the \u2018cis\u2019 face of the GA and the proteins undergo further modification, sorting and packing.

Microtubules direct the movement of the transport vesicle to the GA and the secretory vesicle to the cell surface membrane.\n\n# Cell Theory states that:\n\n1. Cells are the smallest unit of life.\n2. All cells come from pre-existing cells.\n3. Living organisms are composed of cells.\n\nDraw plan diagrams of tissues and calculate linear magnifications of drawings.\n\n* When making drawings remember, STAMP\n\n- S: Size of drawing must occupy 2/3 of given space\n- T: Title must include: plane of section, name of specimen, name of tissue/cell, magnification e.g. T.S. of epidermal cell of onion (LP)\n- A: Annotation and Labels e.g. cytoplasm starts to pull away from cell wall (not just cytoplasm)\n- M: Magnification\n- P: Proportion and Lines: e.g. Cell wall cannot be too thick when drawing a plant cell. It must be proportional to the rest of the cell.\n\nPrepared by: Mrs Selvamani Nair\n\nRaffles Institution (Yr 5-6)\n\n2",
