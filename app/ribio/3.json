Haemoglobin has a quaternary structure made up of 4 polypeptide subunits: 2 \u03b1-globin subunits and 2 \u03b2-globin subunits. Each subunit is made of globin polypeptide and a prosthetic (non-protein) component called haem group. Each haem group consists of a porphyrin ring and an iron ion (Fe2+). 2. Each subunit is arranged so that most of its hydrophilic amino acid side chains are on external surface while its hydrophobic amino acid side chains are buried in interior. 3. The 4 subunits held together by intermolecular interactions formed between R groups (hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds and hydrophobic interactions). No disulfide bridges. **(The binding of successive O2 molecules facilitates binding of the next. Binding of the 1st O2 molecule increases the affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen and hence facilitates the binding of the 2nd O2 molecule. Binding of the 2nd O2 molecule facilitates the binding of the 3rd O2 molecule and so on.)**\"\n\"Collagen (fibrous protein) an essential component of connective tissue in the human body.\",\"1. A tropocollagen molecule consists of three helical polypeptide chains (loose helices, not \u03b1-helices) wound around each other like a rope. (has quaternary but no tertiary structure) 2. Each chain contains about 1000 amino acids and contain a repeating sequence, usually a repeating tripeptide unit: glycine-X-Y, where X is usually proline, Y is usually hydroxyproline. The tropocollagen molecule can form a tight, compact coil as almost every third amino acid in each polypeptide chain is a glycine, the smallest amino acid. This allows it to fit into the restricted space in the center of the triple helix. 3. Extensive hydrogen bonds form between amino acid residues of adjacent polypeptides, hence interaction with water molecules are limited. 4. Adjacent tropocollagen molecules are arranged in a staggered manner. 5. Covalent cross-links between lysine residues at C and N ends of adjacent tropocollagen molecules results in the formation of fibrils. 6. Bundles of fibrils unite to form long collagen fibres.\"",
