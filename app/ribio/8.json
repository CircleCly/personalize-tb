The transferred E. coli were allowed to divide once and were then collected.\n\nCentrifuged in CsCl were all hybrid (14N-15N) DNA. This excluded conservative replication in which no hybrids form.\n\n(c) Some of these cells were then allowed to divide once more. The DNA extracted and centrifuged in CsCl were half hybrid (14N-15N) DNA and half \u201clight\u201d (14N-14N) synthesized strands.\n\n# 3 hypotheses for DNA replication mechanism:\n\n1. Semi-conservative replication: both strands separate by the breaking of hydrogen bonds and each strand acts as a template for the synthesis of a new strand through complementary base pairing. Thus each DNA molecule formed is a hybrid consisting of 1 original strand and 1 newly synthesized strand.\n2. Conservative replication: 2 parental strands re-associate after acting as templates, thus restoring the original double helix. The other DNA molecule consists of 2 newly synthesized strands.\n3. Dispersive replication: Parental DNA molecule is fragmented and dispersed. Daughter molecules are made up of a mixture of old and newly synthesized parts.\n\nPrepared by: Mrs Selvamani Nair\n\nRaffles Institution (Yr 5-6)",

Frame-shift mutation:\n         due to insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not divisible by 3. Hence due to the triplet code, this would disrupt the\n           reading frame and produce a different and non-functional polypeptide\n2. Silent mutation:\n         is a point mutation that does not change the amino acid sequence in a polypeptide\n         it can occur in the either coding or non-coding regions\n         due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, more than one codon can code for the same amino acid, and hence even if the mutation\n           occurs in the coding sequence of a gene, the same polypeptide will be synthesized\n         if the mutation occurs in the non-coding region, the same polypeptide will be synthesised.\n3. Missense mutation\n          is a point mutation in which a single nucleotide change results in a codon that codes for a different amino acid\n          if the new amino acid has similar biochemical properties (e.g. charge, size) to the one that was replaced, the mutation is said to be\n           conservative\n          if the new amino acid has different biochemical properties (e.g. charge, size) to the one that was replaced, the mutation is said to be\n           non-conservative\n4. Nonsense mutation\n          is a point mutation which results is a premature stop codon (UAG, UAA, UGA), causing the polypeptide to be truncated and\n           non-functional\nExample of a disease due to a substitution mutation:\nName of disease                    Sickle-cell anaemia\nProtein affected                   Beta-globin chain of haemoglobin (From HbA to HbS)\nDescription of change              Change in DNA : CTC to CAC (substitution)\n                                   Change in mRNA : GAG to GUG\n                                   Change in amino acid : glutamate to valine\nEffect of the change               Charged and hydrophilic glutamate changed to non-polar and hydrophobic valine in HbS.\n                                   At low oxygen concentrations, HbS undergoes a conformation change which will cause the hydrophobic patches on\n                                   different HbS to stick together. This polymerization of HbS results in the formation of abnormal, rigid, rod-like fibres.\n                                   Shape of red blood cell distorted \u2013 sickle shaped.\nEffects of disease                 Sickle red blood cells are more fragile and break easily.\n                                   This results in shortage of red blood cells and poor oxygen transport. This leads to anaemia, lack of energy and heart\n                                   failure.\n                                   Sickle red blood cells may also lodge in small blood vessels and interfere with blood circulation. This will lead to organ\n                                   damage.\nChromosomal aberrations\n\u2022    Chromosomal aberrations can be due to variation in (A) chromosomal structure:\n1. A deletion removes a chromosomal segment.\n2. A duplication repeats a chromosomal segment.\n3. An inversion reverses a segment within a chromosome.\n4. A translocation moves a segment from one chromosome to another, non-homologous one.\nChromosomal deletions and duplications can result in phenotypic abnormalities due to the reduced or additional genes respectively.\nChromosomal inversions and reciprocal translocations can result in disease although the amount of genetic material remains the same as\nthe expression of a gene can be influenced by its new location.\n\n\u2022 Chromosomal aberrations can also be due to variation in (B) chromosomal number:\n1. Aneuploidy is a condition where the cell does not have a chromosome number that is a multiple of the haploid number. Chromosomes are present\n     in either extra or fewer copies than the wild type.\n2. Aneuploidy is a result of a non-disjunction event where:\n     a)     Homologous chromosomes do not move properly to opposite poles during meiosis I                                       OR\n     b)     When sister chromatids fail to separate properly to opposite poles during meiosis II.\nSo one gamete receives two of the same type of chromosome and another gamete receives no copy. If either of the aberrant gametes fuse with a normal\ngamete at fertilisation, the zygote will have an abnormal number of chromosomes i.e. aneuploidy. Mitosis will subsequently transmit the anomaly to all\nembryonic cells.\n\nNon-disjunction can also occur during mitosis.

This may change the 3D shape of the protein, affecting the protein function and subsequently affect the characteristics (phenotype) of the organism.\n\n|Type of mutation|Substitution|Inversion|Insertion|Deletion|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Description|Replacement of one nucleotide by another|A segment of nucleotides separates from the allele and rejoins at the original position but is inverted|One or several nucleotides are inserted into a sequence|One or several nucleotides are removed from a sequence|\n|Result of mutation|1 codon changed|1 or more codons changed|Shifts reading frame from point of mutation|Shifts reading frame from point of mutation|\n|Effect on protein|Minor/Major|Minor / Major, depending on whether a frameshift occurs|Usually Major|Usually Major|\n\n# 1. Frame-shift mutation:\n\nDue to insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not divisible by 3. Hence due to the triplet code, this would disrupt the reading frame and produce a different and non-functional polypeptide.\n\n# 2. Silent mutation:\n\nIs a point mutation that does not change the amino acid sequence in a polypeptide. It can occur in either coding or non-coding regions. Due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, more than one codon can code for the same amino acid, and hence even if the mutation occurs in the coding sequence of a gene, the same polypeptide will be synthesized. If the mutation occurs in the non-coding region, the same polypeptide will be synthesized.\n\n# 3. Missense mutation:\n\nIs a point mutation in which a single nucleotide change results in a codon that codes for a different amino acid. If the new amino acid has similar biochemical properties (e.g. charge, size) to the one that was replaced, the mutation is said to be conservative. If the new amino acid has different biochemical properties (e.g. charge, size) to the one that was replaced, the mutation is said to be non-conservative.\n\n# 4. Nonsense mutation:\n\nIs a point mutation which results in a premature stop codon (UAG, UAA, UGA), causing the polypeptide to be truncated and non-functional.\n\n# Example of a disease due to a substitution mutation:\n\n|Name of disease|Sickle-cell anaemia|\n|---|---|\n|Protein affected|Beta-globin chain of haemoglobin (From HbA to HbS)|\n|Description of change|Change in DNA: CTC to CAC (substitution) Change in mRNA: GAG to GUG Change in amino acid: glutamate to valine|\n|Effect of the change|Charged and hydrophilic glutamate changed to non-polar and hydrophobic valine in HbS. At low oxygen concentrations, HbS undergoes a conformation change which will cause the hydrophobic patches on different HbS to stick together. This polymerization of HbS results in the formation of abnormal, rigid, rod-like fibres. Shape of red blood cell distorted \u2013 sickle shaped.|\n|Effects of disease|Sickle red blood cells are more fragile and break easily. This results in shortage of red blood cells and poor oxygen transport. This leads to anaemia, lack of energy and heart failure. Sickle red blood cells may also lodge in small blood vessels and interfere with blood circulation. This will lead to organ damage.|\n\n# Chromosomal aberrations\n\n\u2022 Chromosomal aberrations can be due to variation in (A) chromosomal structure:\n\n1. A deletion removes a chromosomal segment.\n2. A duplication repeats a chromosomal segment.\n3. An inversion reverses a segment within a chromosome.\n4. A translocation moves a segment from one chromosome to another, non-homologous one.\n\nChromosomal deletions and duplications can result in phenotypic abnormalities due to the reduced or additional genes respectively. Chromosomal inversions and reciprocal translocations can result in disease although the amount of genetic material remains the same as the expression of a gene can be influenced by its new location.\n\n\u2022 Chromosomal aberrations can also be due to variation in (B) chromosomal number:\n\n1. Aneuploidy is a condition where the cell does not have a chromosome number that is a multiple of the haploid number. Chromosomes are present in either extra or fewer copies than the wild type.\n2. Aneuploidy is a result of a non-disjunction event where:\n\nSo one gamete receives two of the same type of chromosome and another gamete receives no copy. If either of the aberrant gametes fuse with a normal gamete at fertilisation, the zygote will have an abnormal number of chromosomes i.e. aneuploidy. Mitosis will subsequently transmit the anomaly to all embryonic cells.\n\nNon-disjunction can also occur during mitosis. If such an error occurs early in embryonic development, then the aneuploid condition is passed on to a large number of cells where the severity of the effect is more pronounced.\n\n\u2022 Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) is result of an extra chromosome 21 (a total of 3 copies), so each body cell has a total of 47 chromosomes. Most cases result from non-disjunction during meiosis I. Individuals with Down syndrome have characteristic facial features, short stature, heart defects, susceptibility to respiratory infection and mental retardation. Most individuals are sexually underdeveloped and sterile.\n\nPrepared by: Mrs Selvamani Nair\n\nRaffles Institution (Yr 5-6)",

Sickle red blood cells may also lodge in small blood vessels and interfere with blood circulation. This will lead to organ damage.\"",

a) It can be replicated accurately             daughter cells have identical copies of DNA as the parent cell\n\u2022         Weak hydrogen bonding between the two strands allow them to separate and

information\n            Collectively, numerous hydrogen bonds hold the two strands of DNA together and adjacent nucleotides in each strand are joined by strong covalent\n            phosphodiester bonds\n\n            c)There is a backup of code\n            DNA is double stranded and one strand to serve as a template for the repair of the other if a mutation occurs on either one.\n\n     a)     d) Coded information can be readily utilised/accessed\n  \u2022         Weak hydrogen bonding allows the template strand to separate from the non-template strand allowing transcription to take place\n  \u2022         Complementary base pairing allows the faithful transfer of info from DNA to RNA in transcription, which will be translated to protein subsequently\n\n            Role of mRNA:\n            1) Messenger RNA (mRNA) serves as a \u2018messenger\u2019 that, in eukaryotes, takes the information out of the nucleus via the nuclear pore to the\n               cytoplasm where translation takes place.\n            2) mRNA acts as a template for translation\n            3) As each codon within the coding region of the mRNA represents an amino acid in a polypeptide, the sequence of codons will determine the\n               polypeptide sequence.\n\n            Role of tRNA:\n            They bring in specific amino acids in a sequence corresponding to the sequence of codon in mRNA to the growing polypeptide.\n            It can facilitate translation due to:\n            1) its ability to bind to a specific single amino acid\n            2) the ability of the anticodon to base-pair with the mRNA codon\n\n            Role of rRNA:\n            1) rRNA associates with a set of proteins to form ribosomes.\n            2) rRNA is the main constituent of the interface between the large and small subunits of the ribosome\n                Thus the small ribosomal subunit can bind to the mRNA as complementary base pairing can occur between the rRNA in the mRNA binding site\n                of the small ribosomal subunit and the mRNA.\n            3) rRNA is the main constituent of the P site (peptidyl-tRNA binding site) and A site (amino-acyl tRNA binding site) on the large ribosomal subunit\n                Hence rRNA enables the binding of aminoacyl-tRNAs to the P site and A site\n            4) An rRNA molecule (peptidyl transferase) on the large ribosomal subunit also catalyses the formation of the peptide bond between the amino\n                group of the new amino acid in the A site and the carboxyl end of the growing polypeptide in the P site.\n\n            Prepared by: Mrs Selvamani Nair                                                    Raffles Institution (Yr 5-6)                                          3",
