GPCR consists of 7 \u03b1-helices connected by three intracellular and three extracellular peptide loops.\n5. As a transmembrane protein that is embedded in a cell's plasma membrane, it is folded such that its amino acid residues with hydrophobic R groups are interacting with the hydrophobic core of the phospholipid bilayer of the plasma membrane and\n6. its amino acids with hydrophilic R groups are arranged within the interior of the protein and also interact with the aqueous interior and exterior of the cell as well as the hydrophilic phosphate heads of phospholipid bilayer.\n7. The extracellular loops have a ligand binding site at which a specific signaling molecule (e.g. glucagon) can bind to the GPCR.\n8. The intracellular domain of GPCR has a G protein binding site that allows binding of a heterotrimeric G protein complex.\n9. When a ligand binds to the ligand binding site at the extracellular side of a GPCR it causes a conformational change of the intracellular domain at the cytoplasmic side of the GPCR,\n10. The activated GPCR can then activate an associated G protein by exchanging its bound GDP for a GTP.\n\nPrepared by Mrs.S.Nair, Mrs.Wong SH & Mdm.S.Cross\n\nRaffles Institution\n\n3",
