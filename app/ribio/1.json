Have many hydroxyl groups which extend out of the ring form hydrogen bonds with water and hence are readily soluble in water and easily transported in animal and plant transport systems\n4.

Made up of many \u03b1-glucose monomers that coil to form helices\n2. 1. Hence is a large yet compact energy store as many \u03b1-glucose monomers can be packed per unit volume\n2. Hence most OH groups are involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding within the helix and few OH groups available for hydrogen bonding with water. Hence starch/glycogen is insoluble in water and the \u03a8w of cells are unaffected by its presence. (Property of starch/glycogen)\n\nAmylopectin and glycogen are branched\n\n# How the structure of cellulose makes it a good STRUCTURAL molecule\n\n1. Adjacent glucose units are inverted 180\u00b0 with respect to each other and hence form a long, linear, unbranched molecule with free OH groups projecting out in both directions which can hydrogen bond with OH groups of other cellulose molecules lying parallel to it and form microfibrils. Hence microfibrils have high tensile strength. (Property of cellulose)\n2. As a macromolecule, cellulose has few OH groups available to hydrogen bond with water as most are involved in interchain hydrogen bonding. Thus only the surface of the microfibril has OH groups that can hydrogen bond with water. Hence cellulose is insoluble in water and the \u03a8w of cells are unaffected by its presence. (Property of cellulose)\n3. The meshwork of microfibrils that form the cell wall have a porous structure and hence the cell wall is freely permeable to water and solutes and allows movement of substances across the cell wall.\n4. Cellulases that hydrolyse cellulose are found in very few organisms. Thus cellulose cannot be hydrolysed and used as a respiratory substrate and is a good structural molecule.\n\nPrepared by: Mrs Selvamani Nair & Mrs Wong SH\n\nRaffles Institution (Yr 5-6)",
