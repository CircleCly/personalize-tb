The DNA sample is mixed with a dense loading dye containing glycerol & 2 coloured dyes. Glycerol makes the DNA sample denser than the buffer solution so that the DNA sample can sink to the bottom of the well.\n3. Since DNA is invisible, the dyes colour the DNA sample and will indicate if the DNA has been loaded correctly into the well. (NB: Loading dyes do not bind to the DNA.)\n4. One dye (corresponds to a 100bp DNA fragment) and often runs ahead of the DNA sample and gives an indication of when electrophoresis must be stopped so that the samples do not run out of the gel. The other dye (corresponds to a 1100bp DNA fragment) and gives an indication of the position of the larger fragments on the gel.\n5. The 2 coloured dyes thus act as visual markers which help to monitor the progress of the migration of the invisible DNA fragments in the gel during electrophoresis.\n6. DNA samples are pipetted into the wells in the gel near the negative electrode.\n7. A DNA ladder (i.e. DNA molecular weight markers) which contains DNA fragments of known sizes, is run in one of the lanes and acts as a standard for which to compare fragments of unknown size in the sample.\n8. Negatively charged DNA is attracted towards the positive electrode (anode) when subjected to an electric current.\n9. The agarose gel matrix made of a meshwork of polymer fibres which impedes movement of longer fragments more than shorter fragments. The longer fragments thus migrate more slowly compared to shorter fragments, leading to a banding pattern observed on the gel.\n10.

To visualize the bands, the gel can be treated with a staining dye that binds DNA (e.g. ethidium bromide, a carcinogen) and fluoresces under UV light.\n12.

Gel slab is placed on top of the sponge and under a nitrocellulose membrane. A stack of paper towels placed on top of nitrocellulose membrane. These are placed in a tray of alkaline solution. A heavy weight is placed above the paper towels.\n2. Absorbent paper towels draw the solution towards themselves and the alkaline solution denatures double-stranded DNA into single-stranded DNA.\n3. Single stranded DNA on the gel is then drawn upwards onto the nitrocellulose membrane below and binds to the membrane (in exactly the same position as they were in the gel).\n4. Nitrocellulose membrane is removed and incubated with single-stranded radioactive DNA probe which hybridises via complementary base pairing to the target sequence.\n5. The excess unhybridised probes are washed off.\n6. Autoradiography is performed placing X-ray film over membrane. Radioactive regions expose the film forming an image that correspond to the bands that have base-paired with probe.\n\nNote: RFLP analysis is a principle/way of analyzing data. PCR, gel electrophoresis and nucleic acid hybridization are tools used in RFLP analysis.\n\n# What are RFLPs?\n\n- RFLP = Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms\n- RFLPs are restriction patterns that arise from restriction digestion using a specific restriction enzyme.\n- RFLPs arise due to DNA polymorphisms which are small nucleotide differences in different individuals at specific locus.\n- Thus due to the polymorphic nature of DNA in different individuals, there will be variations in the:\n1. number/location of restriction sites or\n2. number of tandemly repeated nucleotide sequences. This will result in a unique banding pattern amongst individuals.\n\nThe DNA polymorphism in sickle cell anaemia is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). There is a difference in a single base pair due to a point mutation.\n\nIn sickle cell anaemia this SNP is within the coding region. However, the majority of SNPs used for RFLP analysis are found in non-coding regions.\n\n# Use of RFLP analysis in disease detection e.g. sickle cell anaemia\n\nA difference in single nucleotide can result in a gain OR loss of a restriction site of an enzyme. Thus when a particular section of DNA in individuals with the mutation and without the mutation is digested with the same restriction enzyme, DNA fragments of different lengths will result. Analysis of the banding pattern that arises, will allow determination of the presence of disease-causing allele or the normal allele.\n\ne.g. in sickle-cell anaemia, the disease-causing mutation occurs at restriction site for Mst II within the \u03b2-globin gene.\n\n|Normal|CCTNAGG|Restriction enzyme recognition site for MstII, where|\n|---|---|---|\n|Sickle-cell mutation|CCTNTGG|results in S-type DNA|\n\nIn the disease causing allele, the Mst II restriction site is eliminated. In the normal allele, Mst II restriction site is retained.\n\n# How to determine the genotype of a person for \u03b2-globin gene?\n\n1. Digest genomic DNA from both samples with MstII to obtain different restriction fragments will arise.\n2. Perform gel electrophoresis followed by southern blotting (use of nitrocellulose membrane, radioactive probes and autoradiography).\n\nThe same single-stranded radioactive probe (which is complementary to part of the target sequence) will be used to detect both the presence of A-type and S-type DNA. Hence the site that the probe binds on the DNA fragments should give different banding patterns on the autoradiogram.\n\n# Prepared by:\n\nMrs Selvamani Nair & Ms Eva Hor\n\nRaffles Institution (2019)",
