RNA polymerase is a multimeric complex.\n2. General transcription factors first assemble along the promoter.\n3. General transcription factors recruit RNA polymerase & position it correctly on the promoter.\n4. The complex of RNA polymerase and transcription factors is called the transcription initiation complex.\n5. RNA polymerase unzips the 2 strands of the DNA double helix at promoter by breaking hydrogen bonds between base pairs.\n6. Only one strand is used as the template to synthesise mRNA. (N.B. The template strand is also the non-coding strand)\n\n# IN EUKARYOTES AND PROKARYOTES\n\n# ELONGATION\n\n1. Free ribonucleotides match up with the template DNA strand by complementary base pairing.\n2. Cytosine base pairs with guanine, guanine base pairs with cytosine, thymine base pairs with adenine & adenine base pairs with uracil.\n3. RNA polymerase catalyses the formation of covalent phosphodiester bonds between adjacent ribonucleotides.\n4. As each ribonucleoside triphosphate is brought in, 2 of its terminal phosphate groups are removed and the 5\u2019 end of the resulting ribonucleotide is added to the 3\u2019 end of the growing RNA strand via the formation of a phosphodiester bond.\n5. Thus the mRNA strand is synthesized & elongated in the 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 direction & the template DNA strand is read in the 3\u2019 to 5\u2019 direction.\n6. As the transcription complex continues to move down the DNA double helix, unzipping the 2 strands, and synthesizing mRNA, the region of DNA that has just been transcribed, reanneals.\n\n# IN EUKARYOTES\n\n# TERMINATION\n\n1. RNA polymerase transcribes a sequence on the DNA, which codes for a polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) in the pre-mRNA.\n2. Proteins (endonucleases) bind at a point (10 to 35 nucleotides) downstream of the polyadenylation signal to cut the transcribed terminator and free the pre-mRNA from the polymerase.\n\n|polyadenylation signal|free pre-mRNA|\n|---|---|\n|CUT|5\u2019________________AAUAAA_____________3\u2019|\n| |5\u2019________________AAUAAA__3\u2019|\n\n# POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL MODIFICATION (Only in EUKARYOTES)\n\n1. Addition of methylguanosine cap to 5\u2019 end of pre-mRNA the 5\u2019 cap protects mRNA from degradation by ribonucleases that degrade RNA from the 5\u2019end, serves as a recognition signal for the small ribosomal subunit to assemble & begin translation & facilitates the export of mature mRNA from the nucleus.\n2.
