Growth\n          increase number of cells by producing more cells genetically identical to existing ones\n2. Regeneration and cell replacement\n          damaged cells replaced by cells genetically identical to original ones, retaining the same function.\n3. Asexual reproduction\n          produces genetically identical offspring\n\nNeed for regulation\n1. The cell cycle is tightly regulated as it is important for normal growth & development. Regulation is at certain control points known as\n     checkpoints which are at G, G2 and M phase. These checkpoints are stop and go-ahead signals which determine whether or not the cell1\n     cycle can proceed.\n2. Cancer occurs when the dysregulation of checkpoints of cell division occur or cells escape the cell cycle control mechanism that normally\n     regulates their growth. This leads to uncontrolled division of cells (i.e. tumour formation) and possibly cancer.\n\nSignificance of meiotic cell cycle\n1. For maintenance of chromosome number in every generation\n     Reduction division: production of 4 haploid gametes from 1 diploid parent cell\n     Chromosome number halved so that the chromosome number can be restored upon fertilisation\n        Chromosome number of species remains the same after many generations\n\n2. For genetic variation in offspring in every generation\n     1. Crossing over between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes results in new combinations of alleles on chromatids.\n          (& eventually a variety of offspring)\n     2.

(& eventually in a variety of offspring)\n     3.
