When these barriers are breached the pathogen enters the body tissues.\n\n0 Microbe adheres phagocyte.\n\n2 This will cause phagocytes such as macrophages in the body tissues (A) to engulf the pathogens by phagocytosis and (B) to induce inflammation aim: to recruit more phagocytes.\n\n# (A) Phagocytosis by macrophage:\n\n1. Bacterium becomes attached to membrane evaginations called pseudopodia.\n2. Bacterium is ingested, forming phagosome which then fuses with lysosome forming phagolysosome.\n3. Lysosomal enzymes digest the captured material and digested products are released from the cell by exocytosis.\n\n# (B) How are more phagocytes recruited during inflammation?\n\nPathogen triggers macrophages at site of infection (i.e. infected tissues) to release signalling molecules, chemokines and cytokines which (see table).\n\n|Effect of chemokines and cytokines on blood vessels|Effects|\n|---|---|\n|Vasodilation: widening of blood vessels|More phagocytes can be carried to site of infection from the bloodstream.|\n|Vasopermeability: increase permeability of blood capillaries|More phagocytes can be recruited to site of infection from the bloodstream.|\n|Fluid accumulation at site of infection|(causing swelling)|\n|Release of inflammatory mediators|(causing pain)|\n\nPhagocytes that are recruited to site of infection during inflammation are:\n\n1. macrophages carry out phagocytosis and clear pathogen or function as an antigen presenting cell (APC).\n2. neutrophils found in blood migrate to site of infection carry out phagocytosis and then die and form pus.\n\n* If a pathogen evades the innate immune system (i.e. the barriers and cellular components of the innate immune system are breached) the adaptive immune system is activated by antigen presentation.\n\nPrepared by: Mrs Selvamani Nair, Ms Michelle Nah, Mr Ngan Wei Yeong",

Processing of antigen: antigen is \u2018cut up\u2019 into short peptides inside phagolysosome\n3. Peptides of antigen bind to MHC protein forming peptide-MHC complex\n4. Peptide-MHC complex is transported via vesicles fuses with the cell surface membrane of the APC.\n5. The peptide on the MHC complex is now ready for presentation to the complementary T cell receptor (TCR) on a specific na\u00efve T cell. (See (*****) next to pt. 2. below to see what occurs next)\n\n# Plasma\n\nPhagocytic APCs engulf the extracellular pathogens with pseudopodia.\n\n# Processing of antigen:\n\n- Lysosomal action\n\n# Fig: Antigen presentation in a phagocytic cell\n\nVesicle with peptide-MHC complex fuses with the membrane of APC.\nPeptide on peptide-MHC complex ready for presentation to na\u00efve T cells.\nProcessed peptide of antigen binds to MHC protein forming peptide-MHC complex.\nRough ER produces MHC protein.\n\n# 3. How na\u00efve cells become activated and the adaptive immune response:\n\n1. Unique B cell receptor (BCR) on a specific na\u00efve B cell binds to complementary antigen of the pathogen.\n2. Receptor-mediated endocytosis of the pathogen occurs as the cell surface membrane invaginates and pinches off as an endocytic vesicle.\n3. The pathogen is processed and a peptide of the antigen binds to a MHC protein to form a peptide-MHC complex which is then displayed on the surface of the na\u00efve B cell (an APC).\n4. A specific helper T cell with a specific T cell receptor (TCR) binds to the complementary peptide on the peptide-MHC complex of the specific na\u00efve B cell.\n5. The specific B cell undergoes clonal expansion to form many identical daughter cells and differentiation to form antibody-secreting plasma B cells (effector cells) and memory B cells (not shown).\n6. The antibodies then destroy and clear the extracellular pathogen by neutralisation, opsonisation and agglutination (pg.4).\n7. If the body is re-exposed to the same antigen, the memory B cells rapidly undergo clonal expansion and differentiation into many plasma B cells that can rapidly manufacture large quantities of antigen-specific antibodies.\n\nAn antigen presenting cell (e.g. dendritic cell) forms pseudopodia around the pathogen which fuse and encloses the pathogen in a phagosome by phagocytosis.\nThe pathogen is processed and a peptide of the antigen binds to a MHC protein to form a peptide-MHC complex which is then presented on the surface of the APC (*****).\nA specific naive T cell with a specific T cell receptor (TCR) binds to the complementary peptide-MHC complex of the APC.\nThe APC secretes cytokines that activate the na\u00efve T cells.\n\n# Helper T cell\n\n# Cytotoxic T cell\n\n# Memory T cell\n\nThe specific activated naive T cells undergo clonal expansion to form many identical daughter cells and differentiation into effector T cells (cytotoxic T cells and T helper cells) and memory T cells.\nThe helper T cells secrete cytokines which (a) activate na\u00efve B cells which form plasma B cells and (b) stimulate macrophages to attack infected cells (not shown).\nThe cytotoxic T cells kill cells infected with intracellular pathogens like viruses by producing perforins and granzymes (see pg. 4).\nIf the body is re-exposed to the same antigen, the memory T cells rapidly undergo clonal expansion and differentiation into many helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells.\n\n# * Clonal selection\n\nis a process proposed to explain how a single B or T cell that recognizes an antigen that enters the body is selected from the pre-existing cell pool of differing antigen specificities and then reproduced to generate a clonal cell population that eliminates the antigen.\n\n# * Clonal expansion and differentiation:\n\nrefers to the repeated division of cells by mitosis and specialisation of cells due to differential switching on of genes respectively.\n\nPrepared by: Mrs Selvamani Nair, Ms Michelle Nah, Mr Ngan Wei Yeong",

Somatic hyper-mutation is random point mutation in the rearranged VDJ / VJ regions in activated B cells\n     2. Further diversifies variable regions of antibody for antigen binding (due to slight amino acid differences which result due to\n          the mutation)\n     3. It occurs during clonal expansion of the activated B cells\n     3. Some point mutations result in the B cells expressing low affinity Ig chains on their cell surface membrane and some point\n          mutations result in the B cells expressing higher affinity Ig chains on their cell surface membrane\n     4. B cells that express higher affinity BCR on their cell surface membrane are selected for clonal expansion & differentiation.\n          This is called affinity mutation\n     5. The resulting plasma B cells and memory B cells will have BCRs with higher affinity antigen binding sites for a specific antigen.\n          The plasma B cells will also produce antibodies with higher affinity antigen binding sites for a specific antigen.\n\n     *    Class Switching:\n\n     1.     Class switching is DNA rearrangement at the constant gene segment of the heavy chain gene locus in activated B\n            cells\n     2.
