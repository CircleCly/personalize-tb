This energy is used to\n        actively pump H+ from the mitochondrial matrix to intermembrane space.\n      * This creates a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The energy stored in the form of a H+ gradient across a\n        membrane is known as a proton-motive force.\n      * As protons diffuse through ATP synthase (which projects into the matrix) down the H+ concentration gradient into the mitochondrial\n      matrix, ATP synthase is activated and it phosphorylates ADP to ATP in the matrix.\n\n    Prepared by: Mrs Selvamani Nair (2018)                                             Raffles Institution (Yr 5-6)                                                                     1",

This reaction is catalysed by cytochrome oxidase.\n\n# Prepared by:\n\nMrs Selvamani Nair (2018)\n\nRaffles Institution (Yr 5-6)",

However, FADH2 releases the e-(s) lower in the ETC compared to NADH. Hence,\n             Less energy is released from FADH2 during e- transfer. The regenerated FAD then can pick up e(s) and protons from the Krebs cycle.Protons are pumped across this                                                                                                                                                                                                           -\n                                                         membrane as electrons flow through                                                                                                               outer                                                                           * NAD : nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (a coenzyme)inner                                                          membrane\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       outer\n                                                         the electron transport chain;                                                                                                                    mitochondrial                                                                   * FAD : flavine adenine dinucleotide (a coenzyme)membrane\n                                                                                                                                                                                                          membrane                                                                        * NAD\n           70S ribosomes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   a coenzyme and a mobile electron carriercrista\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                       inner                                                                               carries electrons & protons (in its reduced form, NADH) from\n                                                                            High [ Ht ]                                                                                                                                mitochondrial                                                                          organic molecules to electron carriers in ETC & reduces them\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                       membrane                                                                               while, NADH itself is reoxidised to NAD+\n                                                                                                                 pumping of                                                                                                                matrix                                         * The number of ATP molecules produced per glucose molecule\n                                                                                                                 protons                                                                                                                                                                          can vary between 36 to 38.

However, FADH2 releases the e-(s) lower in the ETC compared to NADH. Hence, less energy is released from FADH2 during e- transfer. The regenerated FAD then can pick up e-(s) and protons from the Krebs cycle. Protons are pumped across this membrane as electrons flow through the electron transport chain; the outer mitochondrial membrane.\n\nNAD: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (a coenzyme)\n\nFAD: flavine adenine dinucleotide (a coenzyme)\n\n70S ribosomes\n\nHigh [H+]\n\nLow [H+]\n\nATP synthase\n\nCircular DNA\n\nA mitochondrion\n\nChemiosmosis: an energy coupling mechanism that uses energy stored in the form of hydrogen ion gradient across a membrane to synthesise ATP.\n\n# Anaerobic Respiration\n\n(1) involves oxidation of glucose in absence of oxygen (2) produces 2 ATP mlcs per glucose molecule\n\nIn the absence of oxygen (O2), there is no final e- acceptor to accept electrons from the electron transport chain (ETC).\n\nElectron carriers remain reduced and so NADH and FADH2 can no longer donate electrons to the ETC. Hence oxidative phosphorylation (OP) cannot occur.\n\nIn absence of oxidative phosphorylation, there is no regeneration of NAD & FAD and thus the link reaction & Krebs cycle cannot occur (because there are no e- acceptors i.e. NAD & FAD).\n\nIn the absence of oxygen, glycolysis can still occur as the NAD needed for glycolysis is regenerated from fermentation reactions.\n\nAlcoholic fermentation occurs in yeasts while lactate fermentation occurs in muscles of animals.\n\nBoth fermentation reactions regenerate NAD from NADH in order to keep glycolysis going. ATP is only produced from glycolysis.\n\nIn animals, pyruvate is reduced by e-(s) from NADH in the presence of lactate dehydrogenase to lactate.\n\nIn yeasts, pyruvate is converted to ethanal from NADH in the presence of alcohol dehydrogenase to ethanol.\n\nThus pyruvate or ethanal are the final e- acceptors during anaerobic respiration.\n\nOnly 2 ATP mlcs are produced per glucose mlc during anaerobic respiration. This is 19 times lower compared to aerobic respiration which produces 38 ATP mlcs per glucose mlc.\n\nFermentation reactions occur in the cytosol.\n\nPrepared by: Mrs Selvamani Nair (2018)\n\nRaffles Institution (Yr 5-6)",
