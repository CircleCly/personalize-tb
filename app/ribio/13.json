                    2018\n  Regulation of gene expression in bacteria\n\n  Operon : is a cluster of genes with related functions, regulated in such a way that all the genes in the cluster are turned on and off together.\n     It includes a common promoter, an operator, and one or more structural genes that are controlled as a unit to produce a single polycistronic mRNA.\n  Promoter: RNA polymerase binding site, upstream of structural genes\n  Operator: repressor protein binding site to prevent RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter and intiating transcription\n  Polycistronic mRNA: A messenger RNA that contains the base sequence coding for the amino acids sequence of several proteins.\n  \u25aa A single mRNA contains multiple start codons (AUG) and stop codons (UAG, UAA, UGA) (one per polypeptide e.g. 3 sets for lac operon, 5 sets for trp\n     operon)\n  \u25aa Gives rise to a total of ___ different polypeptides which can be translated from a single mRNA, illustrating the polycistronic nature of the mRNA\n  Structural gene : Any gene that codes for a protein product that forms part of a structure or has an enzymatic function\n  Regulator gene: Any of several kinds of nucleotide sequences involved in the control of the expression of structural genes\n  \u25aa Codes for a protein involved in regulating the expression of other genes e.g. repressor, CAP\n  \u25aa Has its own promoter and terminator sequences\n  \u25aa Not within operon, usually far away, but gene products that control the expression are diffusible\n  Effector: a small molecule that binds to a specific protein, causing a conformational change and hence regulating its biological activity.\n  In this context, includes inducer (allolactose in lac operon) and corepressor (trptophan in trp operon)\n\n  Purpose/Advantages of Regulation\n\n  \u25aa    Allows the bacteria to make economical use of energy and resources \u2013 prevents wastage/conserve resources i.e. relevant genes are expressed\n       only when necessary\n       o Especially since bacteria are able to use a variety of metabolites e.g. glucose is metabolized preferentially over lactose, thus it is not economical to\n          produce lac genes in the presence of glucose\n       o No need to synthesize a metabolite when it can be taken in from the surroundings\n  \u25aa    Operons\n       o Can be turned \u2018on\u2019 or \u2018off\u2019 according to changes/ conditions of the environment\n       o Allows for functionally related proteins to be synthesized as a unit\n  \u25aa    Enable bacteria to respond rapidly and appropriately to changes in environment\n  \u25aa    All this provides a selective advantage to such bacteria, who can respond to and survive when there are changes in the environment\n\n                                                                         Lac operon                                                                        Trp operon\n\n  Structure
