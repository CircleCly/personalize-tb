This means that if a species can no longer occupy a particular niche, it would be considered a new species. Niche - both the place where an organism lives and its interactions with the environment [i.e. the roles that an organism plays in its habitat (predator, prey, primary producer or consumer, decomposer etc)].|\n|Morphological|A group of organisms sharing the same body shape, size & other structural features.|This definition can be applied to sexual & asexual organisms but it does not consider whether offspring are fertile or not. In addition, researchers may disagree on which structural features distinguish a species as this definition relies on superficial & subjective criteria, & it is known from genetic data that genetically distinct populations may look very similar, & contrarily, large morphological differences can exist between closely related species.|\n|Phylogenetic|The smallest group of organisms that share a most recent common ancestor.|This definition takes into account anatomical, molecular & embryological homologies to recreate an evolutionary history to connect a common ancestor to a group of organisms. However, it does not consider whether or not offspring are fertile.|\n\n# (c) Explain how species are formed with reference to geographical isolation, physiological isolation and behavioural isolation\n\nSpecies are formed when there is a disruption in gene flow between populations of a particular species. Over long periods of time and through natural selection, the populations may evolve into separate species. This gene flow may be disrupted in three ways:\n\n- Geographical isolation \u2013 gene flow between populations of a species is disrupted by valleys, body of water (islands), or by plate tectonics\n- Physiological isolation \u2013 within a geographical location, gene flow is disrupted by incompatibility in sperm and eggs or pollen and stigma such that no fertilization can take place. Or different fertile seasons might arise within a population such that two breeding populations are formed that have their gene flow disrupted.\n- Behavioural isolation \u2013 different mate preference may arise due to different mating calls, preference for particular morphological patterns within a population such that a group of mating individuals isolate themselves from the main population, disrupting gene flow.\n\nSpeciation due to geographical isolation is also called allopatric speciation. Speciation that occurs when populations are not separated geographically but gene flow is disrupted by physiological and behavioural isolation is called sympatric speciation.\n\n# (d) Explain the relationship between classification and phylogeny.\n\nPhylogeny: The organization of species according to particular characteristics based on ancestor-descendent relationships where closely related species share a recent common ancestor. Usually presented in the form of a tree.\n\nClassification: The grouping & naming of organisms into meaningful sets or divisions on the basis of their common characteristics. May not take into account evolutionary relationships.\n\nThe relationship between classification & phylogeny is that modern classification now takes into account evolutionary relationships. Taxonomists have adapted the classification system to better represent evolutionary relationships such that a group of organisms that fall into a similar branch of the evolutionary tree, i.e. are monophyletic, should be classified as belonging to the same group (e.g. species, genus, family, etc).\n\nDiversity & Evolution (2010) Raffles Institution\n\nPrepared by: Mrs Selvi Nair, Mr Ngan WY & Mr Adrian Loo",

Barks were covered with soot & thus appeared darker.\n                         Thus lighter forms of moth became easy prey to birds & their numbers declined.\n                         The darker forms of moth were camouflaged & thus proliferated.\n       Differential reproductive success\n                        Thus the melanic form had a selective advantage in polluted areas & increased in frequency there.\n                        and the lighter form had a selective advantage in non-polluted areas & increased in frequency there.\n       [NB: It is incorrect to imply that industrialisation caused the melanic form of peppered moth to appear.]\n\n\u2756     Example 2:\n      1940s: antibiotics first used to kill         bacteria.\n\n      Variation (resistant and non-resistant bacterial strains) exists naturally\n                         Resistant strains arose by spontaneous mutations or have gained a plasmid with an antibiotic resistance gene through conjugation\n                        Mutants:       1) produce enzymes to break down antibiotics\n                                 OR 2) can utilise another pathway thus bypassing the pathway that is blocked by antibiotics\n                                 OR 3) do not to permit antibiotics to bind to their cell surface\n      Selection pressure\n                         Antibiotics kill most of non-resistant individuals.\n\n      Differential reproductive success\n                        Resistant individuals survive & reproduce, passing gene for antibiotic resistance to offspring.\n                        Antibiotic-resistant allele frequency increases among population of resistant individuals.\n      Additional applications of the same antibiotic\n                         Selection pressure now favours resistant mutant strains which have a selective advantage.\n                         Further use of the same antibiotic will be less effective as resistant strains are adapted to environment.\n                         Thus new antibiotics have to be developed to eliminate the resistant bacteria. However, new resistant bacteria which are resistant to the\n                         new antibiotic will arise eventually. e.g. the resistant bacterium: VRSA: vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus\n     [NB: It is incorrect to imply that the antibiotics cause the bacteria to mutate into resistant strains.]\n(g)   Explain how natural selection may bring about evolution.\n\u2756     The theory of evolution by natural selection was put forward by Charles Darwin.\n\n(1)   Overproduction of offspring : All organisms are capable of producing large number of offspring. If all of the offspring survived, there would be a\n                                                 geometric increase in population size.\n(2)   Constancy of numbers : However the size of most populations remain relatively constant as many of the offspring die before they reach reproductive\n                                         age due to limited resources & predators.\n(3)   Struggle for existence           : Thus individuals of a species are constantly competing with each other for limited resources (eg:food, mates & shelter) & in this\n                                        struggle, only a few individuals reach maturity & reproduce.\n(4)   Variation within a population : Individuals in a population differ from each other. These variations which arise spontaneously, are a pre-requisite for\n                                                 evolution by natural selection.\n(5)   Survival of the fittest by natural selection : Among the variety of individuals, some better adapted to the environment & hence are able to survive to\n                                                                    reproductive age & produce viable, fertile offspring. These individuals are selected by their\n                                                                    environment/nature while those that are less well adapted will be eliminated.\n(6)   Like produces like : Individuals who survive long enough to breed successfully are likely to produce offspring similar to themselves. Thus advantageous\n                                  characteristics are passed on to the offspring.\n(7)   Formation of a new species : Individuals with advantageous characteristics are more likely to survive and reproduce & thus with each successive\n                                                generation, the proportion of individuals having the advantageous characteristics will increase (while those without them\n                                                will decrease). Over a long period of time, with genetic isolation (i.e. no gene flow), a new species can form.\n(h)   Explain why the population is the smallest unit that can evolve.\n\n\u2756     Individuals do NOT evolve, populations evolve.\n\n\u2756     Evolution = the change in the composition of alleles                      in a population\n\n\u2756     Variation exists in a population. Natural selection acts on the individuals in a population & results in the perpetuation of selected advantageous\n      alleles into successive generations. Without a population, an advantageous trait cannot be passed on.\n\n\u2756     Over many generations, a higher proportion of the population will bear the selected alleles. Thus, a change in the composition different types of alleles\n      can only occur in a population & not in individuals, since                 individuals do not adapt within their lifetime.\n   Diversity & Evolution(2010)                                                            Raffles Institution                                                               2\n   Prepared by: Mrs Selvi Nair, Mr Ngan WY & Mr Adrian Loo",

Resistant strains arose by spontaneous mutations or have gained a plasmid with an antibiotic resistance gene through conjugation.\n- Mutants: 1) produce enzymes to break down antibiotics OR 2) can utilise another pathway thus bypassing the pathway that is blocked by antibiotics OR 3) do not permit antibiotics to bind to their cell surface.\n- Selection pressure: Antibiotics kill most of non-resistant individuals.\n- Differential reproductive success: Resistant individuals survive & reproduce, passing gene for antibiotic resistance to offspring. Antibiotic-resistant allele frequency increases among population of resistant individuals.\n- Additional applications of the same antibiotic: Selection pressure now favours resistant mutant strains which have a selective advantage. Further use of the same antibiotic will be less effective as resistant strains are adapted to environment. Thus new antibiotics have to be developed to eliminate the resistant bacteria.

[Note: This part is about how important molecular phylogenies are].\n\u2756      Over the past few decades, the comparison of nucleotide and amino acid sequences has revolutionized our understanding of the evolutionary\n       relationships for many groups of organisms and have led to extensive revisions of the classification of all life-forms.\n\u2756      Molecular phylogeny has become a standards means for elucidating evolutionary relationships. Almost all phylogenies are generated using DNA\n       sequences.\n\u2756      DNA sequencing is generally considered superior for evolutionary studies since the actions of evolution are ultimately reflected in the genetic\n       sequences.\n\u2756      Applying the molecular clock            to phylogenetic trees can help us estimate the time of speciation of modern to ancient species.\n\u2756      Gene data (DNA) and protein sequences, are accumulating at an increasing rate because of recent advances in molecular biology hence the evolutionary\n       history of more and more organisms can be included in the tree of life.\n\u2756      Molecular phylogenetics can be used in inferring a) the origins of modern humans and b) the origin of acquired immune deficiency syndrome\n       (AIDS), c) inferring the relationships of cryptic organisms such as bacteria that may be difficult to identify using morphology, d) inferring relationships\n       between organisms that are too morphologically different (such as bacteria and humans) to infer relationships using morphological comparisons.\n\nAdvantages of molecular (nucleotide and amino acid sequences) methods in classifying organisms. [Note: this part focuses on the methods].\n\u2756      All known life is based on nucleic acids & amino acids.\n\u2756      Molecular methods are objective & quantitative as molecular character states are unambiguous (e.g. A, C, G & T) whereas some morphological\n       characters, such as those based on the shape of a structure or colour, can be less easy to distinguish objectively.\n\u2756      Nucleotide sequences for a rapidly increasing number of genomes & amino acid sequences for many proteins can be accessed from electronic\n       databases for comparative study & classification of all life.\n\u2756      Molecular methods offer a limitless set of characters to be studied. Each nucleotide position can be considered a character to distinguish between\n       species.\n\u2756      When molecular data are used                a single experiment (sequencing) can provide information on many different characters.\n                                                    it is easily converted to numerical forms & hence is amenable to mathematical & statistical analysis.\n\n(l)   Explain how genetic variation (including recessive alleles) may be preserved in a natural population.\n      [NB: It is also important to know how to explain how genetic variation occurs in a natural population besides explaining how recessive alleles may be\n             preserved.]\n\n\u2756      How may genetic variation occur in natural populations?\n(1)   Mutations (Gene mutations, chromosomal mutations)\n       (a)   Gene mutations\n       These include substitution, deletion or insertion of a nucleotide that changes the triplet code & hence the amino acid. Mutations in non-coding\n       regions such as the promoter & enhancer can result in phenotypic variation as well.\n\n       (b)   Chromosomal mutations\n       Polyploidy - when more than 2 homologous sets of chromosomes are present e.g., triploids: 3n, tetraploid: 4n.\n       Aneuploidy - when a particular chromosome is over-represented or under-representated e.g Trisomy 21\n       Deletion - when a segment of a chromosome is missing e.g. cri-du-chat disease where there is a deletion of chromosome\n       Duplication - when an extra segment of a chromosome is present.\n       Inversion - when a chromosome segment is detached, flipped around 180 degrees & reattached to the rest of the chromosome\n       Translocation - when a segment from one chromosome is detached & reattached to a different chromosome. Therefore linkage relationships are altered.\n\n(2)   Meiosis\n       (a)   Independent arrangement & separation of homologous chromosomes during metaphase I & anaphase I respectively\n             Independent arrangement & separation of sister chromatids during metaphase II and anaphase II respectively\n                  results in gametes with numerous combinations of maternal & paternal chromosomes.\n       (b)   Crossing over between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes results in more allelic combinations.\n\n(3)    Sexual Reproduction\n       Random fusion of gametes add to the variety of genotypes. Different genotypes will result in different phenotypes and these will act as raw materials for\n       natural selection.\n\n\u2756      How are recessive alleles be preserved in a natural population?\n(1)    Diploidy \u2013 Heterozygote protection\n       A gene can be dominant/recessive. Dominant alleles mask the effect of recessive alleles. Thus even if recessive alleles may be less favorable in the\n       current environment, they persist because they are propagated in heterozygous individuals.\n\n(2)    Heterozygote advantage\n       e.g. sickle cell anaemia: Although homozygous recessive individuals suffer from sickle cell anaemia, heterozygous individuals have selective advantage\n       as they have resistance to malaria due to the single recessive allele.

Mutations (Gene mutations, chromosomal mutations)\n- Gene mutations\n- These include substitution, deletion or insertion of a nucleotide that changes the triplet code & hence the amino acid. Mutations in non-coding regions such as the promoter & enhancer can result in phenotypic variation as well.\n- Chromosomal mutations\n- Polyploidy - when more than 2 homologous sets of chromosomes are present e.g., triploids: 3n, tetraploid: 4n.\n- Aneuploidy - when a particular chromosome is over-represented or under-represented e.g Trisomy 21.\n- Deletion - when a segment of a chromosome is missing e.g. cri-du-chat disease where there is a deletion of chromosome.\n- Duplication - when an extra segment of a chromosome is present.\n- Inversion - when a chromosome segment is detached, flipped around 180 degrees & reattached to the rest of the chromosome.\n- Translocation - when a segment from one chromosome is detached & reattached to a different chromosome. Therefore linkage relationships are altered.\n2. Meiosis\n- (a) Independent arrangement & separation of homologous chromosomes during metaphase I & anaphase I respectively independent arrangement & separation of sister chromatids during metaphase II and anaphase II respectively results in gametes with numerous combinations of maternal & paternal chromosomes.\n- (b) Crossing over between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes results in more allelic combinations.\n3. Sexual Reproduction\n- Random fusion of gametes add to the variety of genotypes. Different genotypes will result in different phenotypes and these will act as raw materials for natural selection.\n\n# How are recessive alleles preserved in a natural population?\n\n1. Diploidy \u2013 Heterozygote protection\n- A gene can be dominant/recessive. Dominant alleles mask the effect of recessive alleles. Thus even if recessive alleles may be less favorable in the current environment, they persist because they are propagated in heterozygous individuals.\n2. Heterozygote advantage\n- e.g. sickle cell anaemia: Although homozygous recessive individuals suffer from sickle cell anaemia, heterozygous individuals have selective advantage as they have resistance to malaria due to the single recessive allele. Hence recessive allele can remain in a population in malaria-stricken zone.\n3. Inbreeding\n- Inbreeding occurs when two closely related individuals breed & produce offspring. Although homozygous recessive alleles die before they mate, the recessive allele is perpetuated through the long line of carriers hence maintaining the recessive alleles.\n\n# (m) Briefly describe the neutral theory of molecular evolution.\n\n1.

Bottleneck effect \u2013 A population size is dramatically reduced due to catastrophe and then rebounds (in size after a few generations). The initial reduction leads to certain alleles being overrepresented or underrepresented among the survivors and even though the population numbers may rebound to the original, genetic variation is usually reduced.\n\nDiversity & Evolution (2010) Raffles Institution\n\nPrepared by: Mrs Selvi Nair, Mr Ngan WY & Mr Adrian Loo",
