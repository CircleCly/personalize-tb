The non-pluripotent cell is therefore induced to become pluripotent. The iPSC technology was pioneered by\n            Shinya Yamanaka\u2019s lab in 2006 that the introduction of four specific genes encoding transcription factors could \u2018reprogramme\u2019 some specialised cells to\n            become pluripotent so that they lose their specialised functions and behave in virtually the same way as embryonic stem cell.\n\n            Advantages of iPSCs                                                                                                   Possible problems of iPSCs\n\n\u2022     Since iPSCs can be obtained directly from adult tissues, it does not generate or\n      destroy any human embryos.\n\u2022     Adult tissue (e.g. skin cells) required to make iPSCs can be easily obtained from\n      donor without risk to the donor\n\u2022     In contrast to ES cells extracted from human embryos, iPSCs derived from a patient\u2019s\n      own cells would open the possibility of generating lots of patient-specific cells, which\n      will not be rejected by the immune system (as it is not a foreign cell) upon\n      transplantation.\n\u2022     Hence, there will also be no need to use immunosuppressant drugs after\n      transplantation and the problem of looking for a suitable donor for transplantation will\n      also be overcome.\n\u2022     Further, it also allows the generation of pluripotent stem cell lines from patients with\n      inherited diseases, in order to better understand why the diseases develop and\n      use in personalized drug discovery efforts.\n\u2022     An additional reproductive technology that may be enabled by iPSCs is the\n      generation of sex cells (sperm and eggs) for treating infertility.\n\u2022      Low efficiency: in general, the conversion to\n       adult somatic cells to iPSCs has been incredibly\n       low. For example, the rate at which somatic cells\n       were reprogrammed into iPSCs in was 0.01\u2013\n       0.1%.\n\u2022      Genetic modification of adult somatic cells to\n       obtain      iPSCs       may       cause       cancer        by\n       overexpression of proto oncogenes or switching\n       off of tumour suppressor genes.\n\u2022      There are ethical concerns (e.g. lack of consent,\n       long term unexpected consequences) related to\n       the creation of embryos and children from IPSC-\n       derived sex cells.\n\n\n\n\n            Ethical complications are related to the means of obtaining stem cells (e.g. techniques involving the destruction of human embryos), human cloning\n            and the exploitation of embryo and egg donors. The use of iPSCs still appears to overcome many ethical issues and provides viable solutions\n            related to stem cell research.\n\n            Comparison of human embryonic stem cells and human adult stem cells\n\n                                                        Embryonic stem cells                                             Adult stem cells\n\nDifferentiation ability\n\n\nRole in body\n\nSources\n\n\nAdvantages in research and\ntherapy development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPluripotent: capable of becoming any cell in the                 Multipotent: typically only give rise to the cells of the tissue\nhuman body except extraembryonic tissue e.g.                     in which they are found.\nplacenta.\nTo develop the embryo into an entire human.
